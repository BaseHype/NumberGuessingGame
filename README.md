## Description

The project aimed to improve on a simple console application beginner C# project and turn it into a graphical text-based game. The goal is to apply the fundamentals of C# in creating a number-guessing console application and learning how to shift the application from a console to having a graphical user interface. The bonus would be to handle the storage of the best results on the local machine's storage.

## Features

- Simple Graphical User Interface
- Level selection, attempt counter and reset button
- feedback window and high score window
- Able to save high scores on local machine

## Installation

To run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Open Visual Studio 2022
2. Clone the repository: 'https://github.com/BaseHype/NumberGuessingGame.git'
3. Open the project solution
4. Install .NET version 6.0
5. Start the application.

## Usage

Once the application is running, select your desired level of difficulty. A range will then be given and a number selected. Attempt to guess the generated number in the least amount of attempts. If your attempt is less than any previous attempt it will be added to the leaderboard. Could you make sure to save to keep a record of your scores?
